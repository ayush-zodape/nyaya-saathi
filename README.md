> AI-Powered Legal Rights & Grievance Drafting Assistant for Marginalized Communities in India

## What is Nyaya Saathi?

Nyaya Saathi helps marginalized communities in India understand their legal rights and take action — in their own language, without needing a lawyer.

**Problem:** India has 1,800+ laws, but 80M+ eligible Indians don't access free legal aid because legal language is impenetrable, lawyers are expensive, and awareness is near-zero.

**Solution:** Describe your situation in plain Hindi/English → AI identifies your legal rights with specific Act & Section citations → Get auto-drafted complaint letters, RTI applications, and step-by-step action guides.
